# demofork

Library used:
  Frontend:
  - react-router-dom, 
  - react-chartjs-2, 
  - chart.js,
  - react, 
  - react-bootstrap 
  - bootstrap

  Backend:
  - Mongoose

Database trying to use:
- MongoDB (applying MERN stack in this project)


Usage:
- You can check the graphs by clicking different tabs
- The tree diagram trial for NoSql can be found in src a file named "this is for demofork".pdf
- Backend.App.js is to tro to use mongoose to deply a database and create a schema for it
- Node js query code has not been done within this git but i think it will be similar to both nosql and other sql(e.g. Postgresql)


Difficulties:
- Unfamiliar with noSql with new trial from learning online through different tutorials
- Got difficulties with calling upon different Collections and use functions to update (esp.calling the documents is jammed)
- Limited time allowed to thoroughly understand the whole Nosql with quite some differences comparing to relational databases design
